1. Perform refactoring (delegates do not use!) Algorithm sorting lines rectangular integer matrix that allows to sort, as the ascending and descending, depending on the transmission method in the string comparison test matrix (standard interfaces are not used). Test method obtained using the following criteria to compare strings.

* in order of increasing (decreasing) the amounts of elements rows of the matrix;
* in order of increasing (decreasing) the maximum rows of elements;

2. Develop Polinome (polynomial) class to work with polynomials of degree one variable of the real type (as an internal structure for storing coefficients used sz-array). For developed class

* override the necessary methods of class Object;
* overload operation allowed for working with polynomials (excluding polynomial division by a polynomial). Develop unit-tests.
